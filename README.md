Otter Cart
Amazon says it wants half its shippments to be carbon neutral by 2030. This is a huge challenge to tackle considering that everyday, in the US alone, E-Commerce packages travel the same distance from the moon and back, 133,000 times, according to Etsy CEO Josh Silverman.

However, there is strong evidence that suggests one very effective way to reduce the carbon emissions on e-commerce is by influencing consumer behavior to request later shipping dates. According to the research of Dr.Wendy Tate and Dr.Lisa M. Ellram, shipping by tomorrow with Amazon will cost you 50lbs of carbon dioxide, whereas shipping in 4 days will only cost you 8lbs of carbon dioxide. This extrordinary reduction in emissions due to the delayed shipping behavior is also supported in the research of Dr. Josué C. Velázquez Martínez; a sustainable logistics professor at MIT. His research shows that if you are willing to wait a week, you are killing 20 trees instead of 100 compared to express shipping.

This is why we started Otter Cart. We aim to reduce Amazons emissions from shippments by showing users a personalized calculation on the trees they can save by extending the shipping time on their Amazon order. With about 100 million active Amazon prime members around the world, there is huge potential for Otter Cart to really help save the planet.
