# Otter Cart

Amazon says it wants half its shippments to be carbon neutral by 2030. This is a huge challenge to tackle considering that everyday, in the US alone, E-Commerce packages travel the same distance from the moon and back, **133,000 times**, according to Etsy CEO Josh Silverman.

However, there is strong evidence that suggests one very effective way to reduce the carbon emissions on e-commerce is by influencing consumer behavior to request later shipping dates. According to the research of Dr.Wendy Tate and Dr.Lisa M. Ellram, shipping by tomorrow with Amazon will cost you **50lbs of carbon dioxide**, whereas shipping in 4 days will only cost you **8lbs of carbon dioxide**. This extrordinary reduction in emissions due to the delayed shipping behavior is also supported in the research of Dr. Josué C. Velázquez Martínez; a sustainable logistics professor at MIT. His research shows that if you are willing to wait a week, you are **killing 20 trees instead of 100** compared to express shipping.

This is why we started Otter Cart. We aim to reduce Amazons emissions from shippments by showing users a personalized calculation on the trees they can save by extending the shipping time on their Amazon order. With about **100 million active Amazon prime members** around the world, there is huge potential for Otter Cart to really help save the planet.
